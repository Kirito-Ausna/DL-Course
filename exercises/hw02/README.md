# Homework 02. PyTorch Fundamentals Exercises

A big part of deep learning (and learning to code in general) is getting familiar with the documentation of a certain framework you're using. We'll be using the PyTorch documentation a lot throughout the rest of this course. So I'd recommend spending 10-minutes reading the following (it's okay if you don't get some things for now, the focus is not yet full understanding, it's awareness):
  * The documentation on [`torch.Tensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch-tensor).
  * The documentation on [`torch.cuda`](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/cuda.html#cuda-semantics).
