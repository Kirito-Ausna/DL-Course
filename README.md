## Prerequisites

- We will be using Numpy and PyTorch in this class, so you will need to be able to program in python3.

- You will need familiarity with basic calculus (differentiation, chain rule), linear algebra and basic probability.

  

## Course Work

- **Weekly Homeworks** (20%)
  - There are ten weekly homework assignments, each worth 2%.

- **Project Proposal** (30%)
  - You need to make a project proposal. **You are encouraged to start early**!

- **Project Presentation** (50%)
  - You need to make a presentation on the project and submit the associated reports, slides and codes.
